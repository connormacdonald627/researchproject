      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are
        widely used protocols for communication between devices in IoT (Internet
        of Things) networks. However, the performance and overhead of these
        protocols remain obscure in different IoT network scenarios.
      </p>
      <p>
        IoT in this situation refers to the edge networking layer of systems, in
        which devices such as sensors and other embedded devices are connected
        to a centeral node, such as a gateway or server, to transmit or recieve
        data. Assessing the performance of these protocols in this context
        cruical due to the unique characteristics of IoT networks, such as
        limited throughput, high latency, and an increased number of connected
        devices. I will assess the performance of UDP/TCP protocols in this
        context under wireless IoT network conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        These protocols behave very differently: TCP prioritises reliability and
        is connection-oriented, retransmitting packets when acknowledgements
        from the destination are not received. UDP, on the other hand, is
        connectionless and does not guarantee delivery, sending packets without
        confirmation. <a href="#1">[1]</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        The performance of these protocols varies depending on a multitude of
        factors, including but not limited to packet size, network topology and
        throughput. To investigate these variables, NS2 (Network Simulator 2)
        and NAM (Network Animator) will be utilized to assess performance
        metrics such as packet loss by varying bandiwdth and node count in an
        IoT networking scenario. The variance of upstream and downstream traffic
        flow will also be examined to review the performance of these protocols
        under a diverse array of network conditions.

      <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
      <p>
        In this simulation scenario, I have 6 nodes sending upstream to a
        central gateway node and send packets of size 512 bytes. The rate of
        packet transmission is varied from 50,000 bps to 1,000,000 bps with it
        approximately doubling each step.
      </p>
      <h3>Bandwidth & Throughput</h3>
      <p>
        Through experimentation and NS2 simulation results, it was observed that
        TCP signficiantly underperformed UDP in terms of throughput, with TCP
        achieving a maximum rate of 2,091 Kbps whilst UDP achieved a maximum
        rate of 4,187 Kbps which is approximately double the output of TCP; This
        is likely due the implemention of TCP's reliability mechanisms, such as
        slow start and congestion control, along with overhead from
        acknowledgements and retransmissions of dropped data packets.
      </p>
      <h3>Packet Loss</h3>
      <p>
        Whilst TCP's reliabbility mechanisms signficantly reduced throughput, it
        also resulted in a critical reduction in packet loss. With TCP achieving
        a maximum packet loss rate of 5% compared to UDP's maximum packet loss
        rate of 33%. Its worth noting that TCP at 500,000 bps had a packet loss
        rate of 0.39% which may be due to TCP's ability to adapt to network
        conditions using its slow start mechanism which allows it to gradually
        increase its transmission rate until it finds an optiomal rate for
        sending data without overwheling the network; leading to a significant
        reduction in packet loss at higher throughputs.
