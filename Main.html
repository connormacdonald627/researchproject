        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
          TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
          are widely used protocols for communication between devices in IoT
          (Internet of Things) networks. However, the performance and overhead
          of these protocols remain obscure in different IoT network scenarios.
        </p>
        <p>
          IoT in this situation refers to the edge networking layer of systems,
          in which devices such as sensors and other embedded devices are
          connected to a central node, such as a gateway or server, to transmit
          or receive data. Assessing the performance of these protocols in this
          context cruical due to the unique characteristics of IoT networks,
          such as limited throughput, high latency, and an increased number of
          connected devices. I will assess the performance of UDP/TCP protocols
          in this context under wireless IoT network conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          These protocols behave very differently: TCP prioritises reliability
          and is connection-oriented, retransmitting packets when
          acknowledgements from the destination are not received. UDP, on the
          other hand, is connectionless and does not guarantee delivery, sending
          packets without confirmation. <a href="#1">[1]</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          The performance of these protocols varies depending on a multitude of
          factors, including but not limited to packet size, network topology
          and throughput. To investigate these variables, NS2 (Network Simulator
          2) will be utilized to assess performance metrics such as packet loss
          by varying bandwidth and node count in an IoT networking scenario. The
          variance of upstream and downstream traffic flow will also be examined
          to review the performance of these protocols under a diverse array of
          network conditions.

          <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
          <section id="bandwidth">
            <h1>Bandwidth & Throughput</h1>
            <p>
              In this simulation scenario, I have 6 nodes sending upstream to a
              central gateway node and send packets of size 512 bytes. The rate
              of packet transmission is varied from 50,000 byte/s to 1,000,000
              byte/s with it approximately doubling each step. Each experiment
              runs for 20 seconds and the performance of TCP and UDP is assessed
              by measuring the total throughput and packet loss from the raw
              data from each NS2 simulation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through experimentation and NS2 simulation results, it was
              observed that TCP significantly underperformed UDP in terms of
              throughput, with TCP achieving a maximum rate of 2,091 Kbps whilst
              UDP achieved a maximum rate of 4,187 Kbps which is approximately
              double the output of TCP; This is likely due to the implementation
              of TCP's reliability mechanisms, such as slow start and congestion
              control, along with overhead from acknowledgements and
              retransmissions of dropped data packets; The consistency of the
              variance in TCP and UDP's throughput across the range of
              bandwidths indicates that TCP's reliability mechanisms impose a
              fixed overhead of approximately 50% of the bandwidth capacity,
              regardless of the total network load.
            </p>
            <h3>Packet Loss</h3>
            <p>
              Whilst TCP's reliability mechanisms significantly reduced
              throughput, it also resulted in a critical reduction in packet
              loss. With TCP achieving a maximum packet loss rate of 5% compared
              to UDP's maximum packet loss rate of 33%. It's worth noting that
              TCP at 500,000 byte/s had a packet loss rate of 0.39% which may be
              due to TCP's ability to adapt to network conditions using its slow
              start mechanism which allows it to gradually increase its
              transmission rate until it finds an optimal rate for sending data
              without overwhelming the network; leading to a significant
              reduction in packet loss at higher throughput.

          <h1>Node Count</h1>

          <p>
            In simulation scenarios with varying numbers of nodes, TCP and UDP's
            throughput and packet loss both have a positive correlation with
            node count. As the number of nodes increases, the throughput of both
            protocols increases due to more node data being transmitted to the
            central gateway, along with an increase in packet loss due to
            network congestion.

          <h2>Throughput & Node Density</h2>
          <p>
            Figure A shows how throughput grows as more nodes join the network.
            UDP maintains a high throughput across all node densities, while
            TCP's throughput is significantly lower due to its connection
            oriented overhead and reliability ensuring implementations. As
            overall node count increases from 10 to 60, overall network
            throughput increases with the network handling the increased traffic
            and node density in this range. <a href="#2">[2]</a>
          </p>

          <h2>Packet Loss Compromises</h2>
          <p>
            Figure B shows that TCP's reliability mechanisms, such as
            acknowledgements and retransmissions, significantly reduce packet
            loss compared to UDP, which lacks these features. As node count
            increases packet loss across all protocols increase due to network
            congestion due to the central gateway becoming a bottleneck for the
            whole network as all nodes send packets simultaneously to a single
            gateway. <a href="#2">[2]</a>
          </p>

          <h2>Implications for IoT Network Design and Topology</h2>
          <p>
            The results from the simulation scenarios with varying node counts
            indicate that there is a compromise between throughput and
            reliability as node count increases, which aligns with my findings
            from the bandwidth simulation scenarios.
          </p>
          <p>
            In high density IoT sensor networks; Networks that prioritise
            throughput may need to accept higher packet loss rates and may be
            better suited to protocols such as UDP, while networks that
            prioritise data integrity and reliability may need to accept lower
            throughput and may be better suited to protocols such as TCP.
          </p>
          <p>
            Regardless of protocol choice, the central gateway always becomes a
            bottleneck as node count increases. Multiple gateways or a different
            network topology, such as a hierarchical structure may be better
            adapted to such scenarios to reduce the bottleneck in high density
            IoT networks and improve overall performance as the network scales
            in real world deployments.
