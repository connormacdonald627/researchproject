        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
          TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
          are widely used protocols for communication between devices in IoT
          (Internet of Things) networks. However, the performance and overhead
          of these protocols remain obscure in different IoT network scenarios.
        </p>
        <p>
          IoT in this situation refers to the edge networking layer of systems,
          in which devices such as sensors and other embedded devices are
          connected to a centeral node, such as a gateway or server, to transmit
          or recieve data. Assessing the performance of these protocols in this
          context cruical due to the unique characteristics of IoT networks,
          such as limited throughput, high latency, and an increased number of
          connected devices. I will assess the performance of UDP/TCP protocols
          in this context under wireless IoT network conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          These protocols behave very differently: TCP prioritises reliability
          and is connection-oriented, retransmitting packets when
          acknowledgements from the destination are not received. UDP, on the
          other hand, is connectionless and does not guarantee delivery, sending
          packets without confirmation. <a href="#1">[1]</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          The performance of these protocols varies depending on a multitude of
          factors, including but not limited to packet size, network topology
          and throughput. To investigate these variables, NS2 (Network Simulator
          2) and NAM (Network Animator) will be utilized to assess performance
          metrics such as packet loss by varying bandiwdth and node count in an
          IoT networking scenario. The variance of upstream and downstream
          traffic flow will also be examined to review the performance of these
          protocols under a diverse array of network conditions.

          <section id="bandwidth">
            <h1>Bandwidth & Throughput</h1>
            <p>
              In this simulation scenario, I have 6 nodes sending upstream to a
              central gateway node and send packets of size 512 bytes. The rate
              of packet transmission is varied from 50,000 byte/s to 1,000,000
              byte/s with it approximately doubling each step. Each experiment
              runs for 20 seconds and the performance of TCP and UDP is assessed
              by measuring the total throughput and packet loss from the raw
              data each NS2 simulation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through experimentation and NS2 simulation results, it was
              observed that TCP signficiantly underperformed UDP in terms of
              throughput, with TCP achieving a maximum rate of 2,091 Kbps whilst
              UDP achieved a maximum rate of 4,187 Kbps which is approximately
              double the output of TCP; This is likely due the implemention of
              TCP's reliability mechanisms, such as slow start and congestion
              control, along with overhead from acknowledgements and
              retransmissions of dropped data packets.
            </p>
            <h3>Packet Loss</h3>
            <p>
              Whilst TCP's reliabbility mechanisms signficantly reduced
              throughput, it also resulted in a critical reduction in packet
              loss. With TCP achieving a maximum packet loss rate of 5% compared
              to UDP's maximum packet loss rate of 33%. Its worth noting that
              TCP at 500,000 byte/s had a packet loss rate of 0.39% which may be
              due to TCP's ability to adapt to network conditions using its slow
              start mechanism which allows it to gradually increase its
              transmission rate until it finds an optiomal rate for sending data
              without overwheling the network; leading to a significant
              reduction in packet loss at higher throughputs.

          <h1>Node Count</h1>
          <p>
            In simulation scenarios with varying numbers of nodes, TCP and UDP's
            throughput and packet loss both have a positive correlation with
            node count. As the number of nodes increases, the throughput of both
            protocols increases due to more node data being transmitted to the
            centeral gateway, along with an increase in packet loss due to an
            increase in network congestion.
